Last year the Rails Foundation started the __Rails Luminary Awards__ acknowledging people who’ve contributed to the Rails ecosystem and community with exceptional code, documentation, enthusiasm, or assistance, thereby helping others do more, learn more, or be inspired.

Now, it’s time to nominate a 2024 Luminary.

_Do you know someone who has consistently gone above and beyond to help others, who has shaped discussions, answered countless questions, triaged bugs, added particularly helpful features, or introduced us all to innovative new ideas?_

Nominate these exceptional individuals who you believe deserve to be recognized.

All nominations will be reviewed by Rails Core, and the final pick of Rails Luminaries will receive a trophy for their service, as well as a monetary award of $1,000.

Submit your 2024 Rails Luminary nomination <a href="https://rails-foundation.neetoform.com/bc30089dde483e9ae9a0">here</a>.

Shine bright!
