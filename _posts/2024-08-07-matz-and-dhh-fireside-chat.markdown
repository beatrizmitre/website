Hot on the heels of [yesterday’s 7.2 announcement](https://rubyonrails.org/2024/8/6/Rails-7-2-0-rc-1-has-been-released), we have more good news: the [Rails World](/world/2024) agenda is live, and we added a last-minute session to the program that we think you are going to love: Ruby creator **Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto** will join us at Rails World in Toronto as a special guest of Shopify and the Rails Foundation.

**Matz & DHH, together on stage for the first time**

To close day one, Matz and DHH will share the stage for the very first time for a [fireside chat](https://rubyonrails.org/world/2024/day-1/closing-keynote) about Ruby, Rails and all things open source. This special conversation will be moderated and hosted by Shopify founder and early Rails Core member Tobias Lütke. 

We are beyond excited that Matz has found time in his epic conference schedule to join us for this chat. This is definitely a session that you don’t want to miss!

Check out [the full Rails World agenda here](https://rubyonrails.org/world/2024/agenda/day-1), and don’t forget that [Telos Labs is creating the Rails World app](https://rubyonrails.org/2024/8/1/building-the-rails-world-app-with-telos-labs), so attendees will soon be able to build their personal schedule.

Still more updates coming soon, so stay tuned!

[Rails World](/world/2024) takes place September 26 & 27, 2024 at Evergreen Brickworks in Toronto, Canada. It is currently sold out, but those wishing to join the waiting list can email <a href="mailto:world@rubyonrails.org">world@rubyonrails.org</a>, and we will see what we can do!
